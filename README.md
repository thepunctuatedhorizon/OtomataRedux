# OtomataRedux
Otomata was a flash game that was built on a mathematical idea of cellular automaton.
The fascinating thing was that, with a surprisingly sparse number of cells,
it was easy to produce chaotic (not predictable - as opposed to bad) patterns. 
Put a few music notes on that and it is awesome.  Unfortunately, the internet forgot about this gem.
I want to resurrect it.
